<h2>Personal Information</h2>

<p>Name: 				Kristie Magazinovic </p>
<p>Student ID:			S3807456</p>
<p>Student Email Address:		S3807456@student.RMIT.edu.au</p>
<p>Nationality:			Australian</p>
<h3>Background Information</h3>
<p>I am currently studying a Bachelor of Business (Supply Chain an Logistics). Since Covid19 outbreak I decided to scale back on my full-time role as a National Fleet Manager for Hertz and focus on completing my degree. Studying through Open Universities has allowed me to pace my studies however this has been slow with a demanding job. I am now aiming to finish my degree in May 2021. I grew up on a farm and enjoy horse riding and spending time with my dogs. I also sing and play guitar in my spare time (cheaper than therapy)</p>

<h3>Interest in IT</h3>

<p>While I do not plan on embarking in a career in a heavily IT focused role, working as a senior and national manager over the last 5 years at large international companies has afforded me insight into the complexities of IT within large corporations. IT is an area very poorly understood and undervalued in most Non-Tech corporations. I have seen the adverse effects of having antiquated software platforms that negatively impacts operations resulting in inefficiencies, and poor financial outcomes. As a result, my main interest in IT is focused on internal IT operating systems (i.e. ERP software, MRP software and reporting tools). </p>
<p>At my most recent role, the company used over 250 different operating systems in the Asia Pacific region alone with the main system of operation being a Disk Operating System deployed in the 1990’s and managed by a third party. The system is antiquated rendering needed system updates or improvements expensive, limited, and time consuming. Numerous intermediary systems are needed to upload an extract data and a considerable amount of uploaded data is managed through macro enabled spreadsheets and primitive robotics functions. These uploads often freeze requiring manual intervention. Financial data is extremely difficult to decipher and majority of reporting would require a manual data cleanse prior to running reports via SQL or Python.</p>
 
These difficulties along with a failed ERP implementation at my previous role made me realise the importance of adequate IT platforms within the business. Corporations need to have competent staff that understand the importance of emerging technologies to futureproof operations, improve profit margins, provide better compliance and governance, and eliminate inefficiencies. My aim is to gather at least a small amount of additional insight into IT and how it can improve efficiency and reduce costs in back of house operations. I am hoping a greater understanding of how IT is developed and best used will assist me further in my future roles.

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>

<p>Role: 	   Head of Supply Chain/Logistics.</p>
  
<p>Job Add:  https://www.seek.com.au/job/51179032?type=standard#searchRequestToken=e13c8aa3-afc0-4ed5-8900-b4a37bca07e9.</p>
The above is an Executive level role for a large FMCG company responsible for managing all supply chain functions which would include; procurement, contract management, manufacturing, import and export logistics and last mile delivery functions. At this level the role would be highly strategic with a considerable focus on business improvement an creating value in a highly competitive landscape. 
The position Requires a tertiary qualification in business, supply chain and/or logistics and experience in strategy development and implementation, and improvements to operations and LEAN programs. Remote management of multiple FMCG sites is a must
In less than 6 months I will have the tertiary qualification needed for such a role however at this level a Masters degree may also be an additional expectation (i.e. an MBA or Executive MBA). I have over 5 year experience in senior management and the last 3 years has been spent in a highly strategic role however I would require experience in FMCG as all my experience has been in transport logistics and Fleet.
I would aim to complete an MBA, gain more manufacturing experience and have at least 5 years’ experience in an FMCG company to be prepared for this role. Some of this could be done simultaneously but I personally aim to be in a position of this level or similar (in supply chain or procurement in either an FMCG, Fleet or Shipping company) within the next 5 years

<h2>Personal profile</h2>
<h3>Myers Briggs Result</h3>

<p> ENTJ-T Commander </p>
<p> The second rarest personality types in the general population and the rarest personability type for women with less than 1% of women being an ENTJ. This often means it is difficult to find people I truly relate to.  More Logical than emotional, Extremely independent, ENTJ females often end up in male dominated industries (I have worked in Fleet and logistics for 10 years now)

<h3>Aptitude Test</h3>

<p> These results tell me that my personality is suited to leadership roles. I am extremely efficient, strong willed, strategic and confident however I am stubborn, impatient, can come across as lacking empathy, be cold and ruthless and handle emptions poorly. I am mostly a visual learner, I need to see the material I am learning (which makes a lot of sense as I normally watch Youtube walk throughs to help me learn a process). I am a deductive reasoner; I am more inclined to avoid generalizations in favour of experiments or specific examples. </p>
<p>In a team environment I am most likely to take a leadership role and the listing of my personality type weaknesses may influence my approach to my team. Being more aware that I can be cold, stubborn, and impatient will force me to acknowledge this behaviour when it arises and ensure I do my best to aim to be more patient and empathetic with others.  </p>
<p>This information may also assist in building more robust versatile teams. Being aware of my weaknesses will make me want to choose team members that have strengths where I do not. For example, having auditory and tactical learners on the team and ensuring there are those with abstract and inductive reasoning abilities will ensure the team is as diverse as possible. And having empathetic and patient people will also ensure there is not a team full of stubborn impatient megalomaniacs!! </p>


<h2>Project Idea - My Pet Pal App</h2>
<h3>Overview </h3>
<p> The Project will be centred around the development of a smartphone app to track your pets data and manage their vet visits/events. When you get a new pet (dog, Cat, Horse etc) all the data for the animal would be stored within the app including basic info such as DOB, Sex, Breed, Photos, microchipping details, council registration information, and insurance information. The app would then also track all possible info you wish to enter such as vaccination dates, check ups with Vet, Major surgeries, Diet changes, puppy school dates or horse event calendars, and photos. It could then provide you with reminders or info that may be relevant.</p>
<h3> Motivation </h3>
<p> Australians have one of the highest household rates of pet ownership in the world with over 60% of all Australian Households owning pets. Pets are considered an important part of the families. As an individual who has owned many pets (and values my animals somewhat higher than many humans in my life) it can be extremely difficult to keep track of everything. There is a registry for microchipping data, a profile with the insurance company, council registry etc. Most People aged 18-40 use smartphone apps everyday making it an easy to use tool. The RSPCA states that 70% of Australians between the age of 18-24 are pet owners, which further highlights the feasibility of an app as a valuable tool in keeping track of their pets health and wellbeing. </p>
<h3> Description </h3>
<p> The app would be a simple easy to use tool not requiring any additional hardware. The app would open to a slightly customisable homepage (ability to change colour and positioning of calendar and font etc) that showed a slimline banner of each pet (including only a photo, name and age) and a combined calendar that showed all combined appointment, events etc for each pet loaded. </p>
<p>From the home page you could select a pet profile and access all data by swiping through tabs as follows;  basic information (showing sex, DOB, Microchipping details, insurance company, insurance number), your pets calendar (showing all historical and upcoming appointments and events such as horse trials, puppy school or vet check-ups), a photo gallery, a diet tracker (showing all past and current feed and/or supplements), a medical history page (showing all vaccinations, vet appointments and past/current medicine, entry of a vet appointment will trigger an entry into the calendar for a check-up in 6 or 12 month intervals) and a special tab for breeding information (this can include ovulation dates for mares that may be coming into season or foal etc), and an expenses tab showing all expenses for each animal including vet bills, vaccinations, entry fees, Artificial Insemination fees etc (this page can also include offsets for any fees that have been covered by insurance). Each page can be edited however all historical data will be saved in a bi-annual report
